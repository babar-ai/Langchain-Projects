## How It Works

1. **Scraping the Website**:
   - Starts with a specified URL (e.g., UET Mardan's homepage).
   - Extracts text and internal links from the pages.
   - Limits scraping to 100 pages to balance performance and data coverage.

2. **Processing Data**:
   - Splits extracted content into chunks for efficient processing.
   - Converts chunks into embeddings using **HuggingFace's MiniLM-L6-v2** model.
   - Stores embeddings in **FAISS** for similarity-based retrieval.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - Uses the **ChatGroq LLM** to process natural language queries.
   - Retrieves relevant information from the vector database and other tools.

4. **Agent Interaction**:
   - Responds to user queries with contextual, accurate, and persuasive answers.
   - Highlights UET Mardan's unique features and advantages for potential students.
