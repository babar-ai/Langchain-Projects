# üìä Prompt-Driven Analysis with PandasAI

## Overview

This project enables users to interactively analyze data in CSV files using natural language queries. It leverages **PandasAI**, a smart dataframe library, in combination with the **ChatGroq LLM**, to provide prompt-driven insights directly from uploaded data. The interface is built using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly experience.

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
- Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: Upload a CSV file via the Streamlit interface.
2. **Data Preview**: The app displays the first few rows of the file for a quick overview.
3. **Prompt Input**: Enter a natural language question about the data.
4. **AI Response**: The LLM processes the query and provides a detailed response or visualization.

## Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

## Example Use Case

1. **Upload a Dataset**:
   Upload a CSV file containing your data, such as `sales.csv`.

2. **Ask Questions**:
   Use natural language to query the data, for example:
   - "What are the top 5 products by revenue?"
   - "Show me a line graph of monthly sales trends."

3. **Receive Insights**:
   The app processes your queries and provides:
   - Textual responses with insights.
   - Visualizations (e.g., line graphs or bar charts) based on your data.
