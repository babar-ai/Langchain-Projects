# üéôÔ∏è AI-Powered Voice Bot

## Overview

This project implements an AI-driven voice assistant capable of real-time speech-to-text transcription, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis. By leveraging **Deepgram**, **LangChain**, and **ChatGroq**, the bot delivers a conversational experience, bridging human speech with advanced AI capabilities.

## Features

### üó£Ô∏è Real-Time Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Converts live audio into text using **Deepgram**'s speech-to-text API.
- Processes user input seamlessly with minimal latency.

### ü§ñ Natural Language Understanding
- Uses **ChatGroq** for generating conversational, context-aware responses.
- Integrates LangChain for memory-based interaction, ensuring context is retained across conversations.

### üîä Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Converts AI-generated responses back into human-like speech using **Deepgram**'s TTS API.
- Delivers responses in a natural, conversational tone.

### üí¨ Persistent Conversation
- Maintains conversation history with **ConversationBufferMemory**.
- Provides smooth, multi-turn dialogues by remembering context.
